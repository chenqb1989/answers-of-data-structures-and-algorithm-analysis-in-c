# answers-of-data-structures-and-algorithms-analysis-in-c
This library is the reference code of exercises involving coding in the second edition of data structures and algorithm analysis in c (Mark Allen Weiss). Most of the coding exercises are covered (Chapter 12 exercises were not completed due to deadline). The code in the library is only for reference. Due to time, a lot of tests have not been carried out, so there will be many mistakes. However, every exercise has passed at least one test case, which can ensure the basic function of the code.
本库是《data structures and algorithm analysis in c》第二版（Mark Allen Weiss）书中习题涉及coding的参考代码，包括了绝大部分coding习题（第12章习题由于deadline没有完成）。库中代码只是作为参考，由于时间原因，没有进行大量测试，会存在许多纰漏，但每个习题都通过了至少一个测试用例，可以保证代码的基本功能。
